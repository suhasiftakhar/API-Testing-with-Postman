# API-Testing-with-Postman
Here i tested the API of restful-booker.herokuapp.com. I created a user, updated the information adding the access pass and generated the token pass by using Postman. I also checked several types of status code, matching the information with the data server, checked the pass or fail of test case. I also created a html report with the help Newman.
